# Getting started with Power Systems Virtual Servers
{: #getting-started}

{{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} is an infrastructure as a service offering that you can use to deploy a virtual server, also known as a logical partition (LPAR), in a matter of minutes.
{:shortdesc}

Starting in May 2019, IBM is accepting a limited number of customers to participate in an Early Access Program for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. If your organization wants to participate, send an email to Jose Paez (<a href="mailto:jose.paez@ibm.com">jose.paez@ibm.com</a>) asking for access.
{: important}

You can quickly deploy {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}s to meet your specific business needs. With {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} you can create a hybrid cloud environment that allows you to easily control workload demands.

{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}s can run AIX or IBM i workloads in different geographic locations.

## Before you begin
{: #gs-before-you-begin}

Before you create your first Power Systems Virtual Server instance, review the following prerequisites:

1. Create an IBM Cloud account. To create an IBM Cloud account, see [Sign up for IBM Cloud ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration){: new_window}.

1. Create a public and private SSH key that you can use to securely connect to your {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.

1. (Optional) If you want to use a custom image for the AIX or IBM i operating systems, you must create an IBM Cloud Object Storage and upload the image. For more information, see [Configuring a custom image](/docs/infrastructure/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-custom-image#configuring-custom-image).

## Next steps
{: #gs-next-steps}

With an IBM Cloud account and a private and public SSH key, you are now ready to [Create a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](/docs/infrastructure/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-creating-power-virtual-server#creating-power-virtual-server).
